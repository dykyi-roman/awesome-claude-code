# Performance Audit

Perform a comprehensive performance audit focusing on database queries, memory usage, caching, and algorithm efficiency.

## Input Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract path, level, and optional meta-instructions:

```
Format: <path> [level] [-- <meta-instructions>]

Arguments:
- path: Target directory or file (required, default: current directory)
- level: Audit depth - quick|standard|deep (optional, default: standard)
- -- meta-instructions: Additional focus areas or filters (optional)

Examples:
- /acc-audit-performance ./src
- /acc-audit-performance ./src deep
- /acc-audit-performance ./src quick
- /acc-audit-performance ./src -- focus on memory and caching
- /acc-audit-performance ./src deep -- focus on N+1 queries
- /acc-audit-performance ./src -- level:deep (backward compatible)
```

**Parsing rules:**
1. Split `$ARGUMENTS` by ` -- ` (space-dash-dash-space)
2. First part = positional arguments, Second part = meta-instructions
3. In positional arguments, check if last word is a valid level (`quick|standard|deep`)
4. If level found → extract it; remaining = path
5. Also accept `level:quick|standard|deep` in meta-instructions (backward compatibility)
6. Priority: positional > meta-instruction > default (`standard`)
7. Default path: current directory (if empty)

## Target

- **Path**: First part of `$ARGUMENTS` (before `--`)
- **Meta-instructions**: Second part (after `--`) — customize audit focus

If meta-instructions provided, adjust audit to:
- Focus on specific performance categories
- Skip categories if requested
- Apply additional depth to specific areas
- Modify output verbosity

## Pre-flight Check

1. Verify the path exists:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask user for the project path
   - If path doesn't exist, report error and stop

2. Verify it's a PHP project:
   - Check for `composer.json` or `*.php` files
   - If not a PHP project, report and stop

## Instructions

Use the `acc-performance-reviewer` agent to perform a comprehensive performance audit:

```
Task tool with subagent_type="acc-performance-reviewer"
prompt: "Perform performance audit on [PATH]. Audit level: [LEVEL]. [META-INSTRUCTIONS if provided]

Analyze for:
1. N+1 Query Problems — queries inside loops, missing eager loading
2. Query Efficiency — SELECT *, missing indexes, full table scans
3. Memory Issues — large arrays, missing generators, unbounded loading
4. Caching Strategy — missing cache opportunities, repeated expensive operations
5. Unnecessary Loops — nested loop inefficiency, redundant iterations
6. Lazy Loading Problems — premature loading, missing pagination
7. Batch Processing — single-item vs bulk operations, transaction overhead
8. Algorithm Complexity — O(n²) patterns, exponential growth
9. Connection Pool Issues — leaks, connections in loops, missing cleanup
10. Serialization Overhead — large objects, N+1 during serialization

Provide:
- Severity classification (Critical/Major/Minor)
- Performance impact estimates
- Current vs optimal complexity
- Code examples (problematic and optimized)"
```

## Analysis Scope

### Performance Categories

| Category | Impact | Common Issues |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| N+1 Queries | Database overload | Queries in foreach, lazy loading |
| Query Efficiency | Slow responses | SELECT *, missing indexes |
| Memory Issues | OOM errors | Large collections, no generators |
| Caching | Repeated work | No cache, cache stampede |
| Unnecessary Loops | CPU waste | O(n²), redundant iterations |
| Lazy Loading | Memory bloat | Load everything, no pagination |
| Batch Processing | I/O overhead | Single inserts in loops |
| Algorithm Complexity | Timeouts | Exponential algorithms |
| Connection Pool | Resource exhaustion | Leaks, no cleanup |
| Serialization | API latency | Large JSON, circular refs |

### Detection Patterns

```php
// N+1 Query (Critical)
foreach ($orders as $order) {
    $customer = $customerRepo->find($order->customerId); // Query per iteration
}

// Memory Issue (Major)
$allUsers = $userRepo->findAll(); // Loads millions into memory

// Algorithm Complexity (Major)
foreach ($items as $item) {
    if (in_array($item->id, $processedIds)) { ... } // O(n) inside O(n) = O(n²)
}

// Missing Batch (Major)
foreach ($entities as $entity) {
    $em->persist($entity);
    $em->flush(); // Should batch outside loop
}
```
